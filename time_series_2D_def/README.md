NB! not nice code.

image_correction.m is used first on the images in folder "cam1". 

They are likely in landscape so first it rotates them before applying the image correction. T
his scripts needs to be manually run section by section and supervised.

Load_and_process_data.m is then run of the output images from image_correction.m
